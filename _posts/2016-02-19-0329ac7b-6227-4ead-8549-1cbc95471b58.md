  Exploring and redefining optical vision has become a major focus in my current
  artistic works. The Sight Project, is comprised of a series of binocular
  images. Its emphasis is on ‘how to see’ instead of ‘what to see.’ This work
  focuses on the experience of the image processing capability of our brain
  which is often at odds with what we believe to see with our eyes. One of these
  works, Runners, utilizes the required distance that is needed for optical
  binocular capability. This sculpts the audience’s experiences. When standing
  five feet away, the composed image appears as an empty cage but standing a
  foot away, the image becomes a cage containing both a running man and cheetah.
  The Sight Project promotes a more interactive approach with the audience. The
  images and meanings change in direct relationship with the audience’s optical
  view of the artworks. Art is not just what the artist sees, but what the
  artist makes others see.
